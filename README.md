Memory allocation using First Fit algorithm.
# First Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm in C

This repository contains an implementation of the **First Fit** memory allocation algorithm in C. The First Fit algorithm is used for managing memory in a way that allocates the first available block of memory that fits the process's requirements.

## Overview

The program allows users to:
- Allocate memory to processes.
- Deallocate memory when it is no longer needed.
- Compact memory to eliminate fragmentation.

### Features
- Dynamic memory allocation using linked lists.
- Visualization of memory allocation, deallocation, and compaction.
- Error handling for invalid operations.

## Files Included

- `first_fit.c`: Implementation of the First Fit memory allocation algorithm.
